## How to Run Each Application

To run each application, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

2. Navigate to the root directory of the application you want to run using the terminal.

3. Execute the following command to start the application:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This command will start the development server and open the application in your default browser. You'll be able to view and interact with the application while it's in development mode.

4. Repeat these steps for each application in the project, ensuring that you're in the correct directory for each application when running `npm start`.

If you encounter any issues running the applications or have any specific questions about the code or the development process, feel free to ask!
